# Advanced Quantum Algorithm

This repository demonstrates a simplified implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm using a minimal quantum circuit simulator written in Python. The code is intended as a reference for educational purposes and showcases components such as:

- Quantum state representation via complex vectors
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and its inverse
- Controlled modular exponentiation (placeholder logic for the simulation)
- Period finding to derive non-trivial factors of composite numbers

Run the example with:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4
python3 src/shor.py
```

The simulator is not optimized for performance and only handles very small integers, but highlights the core steps behind Shor's algorithm.
