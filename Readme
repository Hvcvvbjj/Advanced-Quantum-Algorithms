# Advanced Quantum Algorithms

This repository demonstrates a minimal quantum circuit simulator written in Python. The focus is on clarity rather than performance and includes an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm.

## Features

- Quantum state representation via complex vectors
- Basic gates and a simple `QuantumCircuit` abstraction
- Quantum Fourier Transform utilities
- Controlled modular exponentiation (placeholder logic)
- Example algorithms:
  - Shor's factoring method (`src/shor.py`)
  - Grover's search skeleton (`src/algorithms/grover.py`)

## Running

Install the dependency and execute the Shor example:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4
python3 src/shor.py
```

The simulator handles only very small integers but forms the basis for more sophisticated experiments.
