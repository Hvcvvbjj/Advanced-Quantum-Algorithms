"""Blueprint for an advanced quantum framework.

This experimental package sketches a highly modular system intended to
scale across distributed quantum resources and integrate cutting-edge
techniques such as machine-learningâ€“based circuit synthesis and real-time
error mitigation.  Only the high level API is provided for now.
